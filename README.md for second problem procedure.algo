This code is a program that reads in a set of vectors, calculates the dot product of each pair of vectors, and then determines if any of the pairs are orthogonal (i.e., their dot product is equal to zero). 
The dot_product procedure takes in two vectors v1 and v2 as input and returns their dot product in the ps variable passed by reference. 
The program then uses a nested loop to compare each pair of vectors and prints out a message if they are orthogonal.
